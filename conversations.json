            "details": {
              "explanation": "AWS Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for your EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic. You can view and manage them using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs. Each method offers a slightly different experience, but all ultimately allow you to inspect the rules associated with your security groups.",
              "keyPoints": [
                "**AWS Management Console:** The web interface provides a visual and interactive way to browse and inspect security groups. You can filter by VPC, group name, or associated instances. The UI displays inbound and outbound rules clearly.",
                "**AWS CLI:** The command-line interface allows for programmatic access and automation. Use the `aws ec2 describe-security-groups` command to retrieve information about security groups. You can filter by group ID, name, VPC ID, and more. The output is typically in JSON format.",
                "**AWS SDKs:** Software Development Kits (SDKs) for various programming languages (Python, Java, etc.) provide libraries and tools to interact with AWS services. You can use the SDK to programmatically list and inspect security groups. This is useful for scripting and automation.",
                "**Consider Permissions:** You need the appropriate IAM permissions to view and manage security groups. Specifically, ensure you have `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups` permission.",
                "**Filtering:**  Use filters in the CLI and SDKs to narrow down the results and find the specific security groups you are interested in (e.g., by VPC, tag, or group name).",
                "**Security Group Rules:** When examining a security group, pay close attention to the inbound and outbound rules. Understand the ports, protocols, and source/destination CIDR blocks or security groups that are allowed or denied."
